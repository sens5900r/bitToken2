Description:
    This package provides a single function, `bitToken()`, which tokenizes text data in a specified column of a data frame.
    The resulting tokens are returned as a vector or, optionally, as a vector of token lengths.
    Filtering options are also available to allow the user to filter the data frame based on specific values.
